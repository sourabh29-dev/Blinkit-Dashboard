This Power BI project analyses Blinkit's performance across key business areas, including sales, customer preferences, outlet performance, and growth trends. The dashboard highlights a total sales revenue of $1.20M, driven by high-demand categories such as snack foods and soft drinks, with regular-fat products being the most preferred by customers. Outlet analysis reveals that Tier 3 locations and large-sized outlets contribute the most to sales, indicating opportunities for expansion in similar regions and store formats. Sales trends show steady growth over the years, peaking in 2018, reflecting the companyâ€™s strong market presence. While the average customer rating of 3.9 is decent, it suggests room for improvement in customer satisfaction. These findings provide actionable insights for inventory management, outlet optimization, and customer engagement strategies. This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used effectively for data-driven decision-making, enabling Blinkit to identify growth opportunities and enhance its competitive edge.# Blinkit-Dashboard
